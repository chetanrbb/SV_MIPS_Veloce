# NAME

mips-cpu - A MIPS CPU written in SytemVerilog

# DESCRIPTION

An implementation of a MIPS CPU written in SystemVerilog.  This project is in
very early stages and currently only implements the most basic
functionality of a MIPS CPU.

 - 32-bit MIPS processor

 - implemented in Verilog

 - 5 stage pipeline

 - static branch not taken branch predictor

 - branch detection in decode (stage 2)

 - supports stalls to avoid read after write (RAW) and other hazards

 - can forward from memory (stage 4) and write back (stage 5)
   to avoid stalls

Much of the design was inspired by the book "Computer Organization and
Design" by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy (4th ed. 2008).

This project also includes a full set of test benches.  These are
invaluable as a quick check to verify that new changes have not
disrupted previously working functionality.
